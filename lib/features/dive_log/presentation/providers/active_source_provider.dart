/// Null in exactly three cases, all of which send callers to `dive.profile`:
/// - a single-source dive, where `dive.profile` IS that source's series;
/// - sources that never overlap in time, which are the consecutive halves of
///   one dive a Combine stitched together rather than rival recordings of it,
///   so the whole merged series is the dive and drawing one source would hide
///   the rest (#1451);
/// - before the data sources have loaded at all, where the arrangement cannot
///   yet be known and `dive.profile` may still be the merged union for a
///   frame.
///
/// A RELOAD is not one of those cases: see the reads below.
///
/// Once the dive is known to have two or more sources this never returns
/// null: while the per-source profiles are still loading (or the resolved
/// source has no entry) it returns an EMPTY profile for that source, so the
/// chart shows its empty-state placeholder for a frame instead of flashing
/// the merged union.
///
/// This is the one rule behind every chart surface (detail page, fullscreen,
/// dive-list panel). `dive.profile` is the merged union of EVERY source's
/// samples interleaved by timestamp; on a consolidated dive that union
/// alternates between two computers' readings sample by sample, so any
/// surface that draws it renders a full-band sawtooth (#543).
